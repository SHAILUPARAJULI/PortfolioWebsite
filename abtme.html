        <p> Hi I am Shailu parajuli and this is a very random picture of eifle tower, France 
          because of my facination with all things Europe. Talking more about me I like cooking 
          food and trying new cuisines. This is my very first time trying to make a website and 
          I have to say i really enjoyed this task. I want to learn more and improve.
